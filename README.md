# github-streak

Set your Github status message to your current Github contribution streak!

## Usage

Create a personal OAuth token with the full `user` permission, and store it in a file named `.token.txt` in the root of the project directory. Then, simply run the script! (hint: you may want to set a cronjob to run the script daily, to keep your streak status updated)
